Atoi-Golang-Image-to-Ascii-Cli-App


Load the Image:
Use a Go library to open and decode the image file.
You can utilize the image package in the standard library, or you may opt for a third-party library like github.com/disintegration/imaging.
Resize the Image (Optional):
Depending on the size of the image and your desired ASCII output dimensions, you might want to resize the image to a smaller size. This can help manage the number of characters in the ASCII representation.
Convert Pixels to ASCII Characters:
Loop through each pixel of the image.
For each pixel, extract its color values (RGB or grayscale).
Convert the color value to a corresponding ASCII character.
You can map different ranges of color values to different ASCII characters to represent dark and light areas of the image.
If using grayscale, you might simply map a range of grayscale values to different ASCII characters.
Output the ASCII Art:
Print the ASCII representation to the console or save it to a text file.
Experiment and Refine:
Play around with different mappings of color values to ASCII characters and other parameters to achieve the desired look for your ASCII art.
Adjust the size of the ASCII art by adjusting the resolution of the image or the scale of ASCII characters used.
Handle Errors:
Ensure to handle errors gracefully, especially during image loading and processing.
